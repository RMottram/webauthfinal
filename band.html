        <p>A Day To Remember were originally formed back in 2003 from Ocala, Florida, USA. The band has a music style of 'pop mosh' dubbed by the majority of their fans. The style has a mix of emo, hardcore and metal. Back at the start, lead vocalist Jeremy McKinnon, guitarists Neil Westfall and Tom Denney, bassist Josh Woodard and drummer Bobby Scruggs all came together and financed their first EP themselves then later on signing with Indianola Records for their first full-length record in 2005 'And Their Name Was Treason'. That first record sold over 8000 copies by through word of mouth alone. Approximately one year later the band signed with Victory Records and went straight on to put together their second full-length record, 'For Those Who Have Heart' which was released at the start of 2007 along with the newest member Alex Shelnutt replacing Bobby Scruggs on drums. In 2009, their third full-length record 'Homesick' released under Victory Records again towards the end of 2009. Tom Denney left the band after the third record was released which meant Kevin Skaff had to come in to fill in the boots of Tom. The fourth record 'What Separates Me From You' was released just over a year after in 2010. In 2011 a dispute occured invoving the band and Victory Records that lead to the lawsuit of the Victory Records and allowed ADTR to produce and self-release their next album 'Common Courtesy' which was released in 2013. The album achieved several accolades from fans and critics alike even hitting N<sup>o</sup> 37 on the Billboard 200 and highly charted in several nations across the world. The band has now got their sixth full-length record as of 2016 'Bad Vibrations' which has been long awaited since the Common Courtesy days and has several top rated singles such as 'Paranoia', 'Bad Vibrations' and 'Naivety'. The album at its highest peak reached N<sup>o</sup> 2 in USA, N<sup>o</sup> 6 in the UK and N<sup>o</sup> 1 in Australia.</p>
